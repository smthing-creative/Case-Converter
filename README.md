# Case-Converter
List Comprehension is a way to construct a new Python list from an iterable types: lists, tuples, and strings. All without using a for loop or the `.append()` list method.

In this project, I learned how to write a program that takes camelCase of PascalCase string and converts them into snake_case using loops and list comprehension.
